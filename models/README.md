# Innerve 2k19

This github repository contains web-based, android-based, and server-based files for our project each in a separate directory.
The idea is to create an assistive android and web based platform for early diagnosis of severe yet curable diseases.
We implemented the above idea for the following diseases:

- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Brain Tumor
- Skin Cancer

With the service we are providing you, days of diagnosis are reduce to few seconds. The idea is discussed in detain in the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eGThYkz9tSb3KBj6xPqzCeuo6vY97DWkzT1F5-prw4Y/edit?usp=sharing). (explanation also available)
